In a few words, I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for programming, physics and mathematics. 
Fueled by a genuine curiosity, I find myself drawn to a diverse array of disciplines, where the interplay of principles and theories captivates my intellectual appetite. 
I feel enriched to discover new things and expand my knowledge.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at [Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze](https://www.unifi.it/) and a Master of Science at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) with a specialization in Mechatronics & Robotics.

Currently, I'm working as a Project Engineer at [Atlas Copco](https://www.atlascopco.com/) with a focus on Model Based Engineering and simulations of oil-free screw compressors.
