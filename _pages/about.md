In a few words, I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for programming, physics and mathematics.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at [Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze](https://www.unifi.it/) and a Master of Science with a specialization in Mechatronics & Robotics at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

Currently, I'm working as a Project Engineer at [Atlas Copco](https://www.atlascopco.com/) with a focus on Model Based Engineering and simulations of oil-free screw compressors.
