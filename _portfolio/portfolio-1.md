### Introduction

### 1. Bending waves in thin rectangular plates

In this project, a theoretical plate's vibration behavior is analyzed analytically and with a Finite Element Analysis made with a MATLAB script. Two different constraint conditions are considered, in the first part the plate is constrained on all four edges and later only on two opposite ones.

## Rectangular plate supported on the four edges

The mode shapes and natural frequencies of the plate are evaluated analytically and the first 6 mode shapes are shown in the figure below
